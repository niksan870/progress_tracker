# progress_tracker

The purpose of this application is to provide you with a flexible tracking system that can be easily customisable by the user. 
One of it's main features is the goal tracking setup where you can work towards a specific goal either alone or in a group.
The core of the working process is a pomodoro clock that tracks how much time you've spent on working/studying.
